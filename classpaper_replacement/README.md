# What's this?
In my school's IT lessons we have learned about HTML and CSS this year. As a replacement of writing a class paper 
we were given around 10-12 weeks to create our own personal website. The task was to implement everything
that we learned somehow and some additional things where we are supposed to reach out for ourselves.

The website should be based on a box model using special positions like relative and floating using CSS. Our main
website should also have a connection to another smaller website that is in terms of topic related to the main website.


# My implementation
Since my HTML and CSS skills are "a little bit" more advanced than the others I will do it using div containers instead of
the box layout, because it's easier. 

I will make a website about my favourite singer which is as of now Nadya Dorofeeva. As the underlying website I will 
link shortly to Vremya i Steklo.

# Project Finished! 
I presented my project on 15th of May 2025 to my teacher and got 3
grades for it. 

1) = 1
2) = 1
3) = 1

Basically a short explanation to the german grade system:
- 1 = best (very good)
- 2 = good
- 3 = okay
- 4 = enough (to pass, but still bad)
- 5 = not enough (bad)
- 6 = worst (very bad)

So basically I got the best grades possible xD
