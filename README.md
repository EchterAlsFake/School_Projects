# What's this?

School Projects, as the repository name indicates is basically an archive of all projects
that I do for school that are somehow related to programming. 

So for example, when I get a task to do something, I will always upload the task and the progress
publicly because I think that making that public is good. I don't know lol. 

I try to make all work generally in English, but I don't know how much this will be possible, because
my teachers could require me to write in German. In this case code comments and internal naming
will be in German. 

I will also tell you the grades I get for every project once it's finished.


# German grading system
You can get the following marks:

- 1 (Very good) [PASS]
- 2 (good) [PASS]
- 3 (OK) [PASS]
- 4 (enough) [PASS]
- 5 (meh) [FAIL]
- 6 (not enough) [FAIL]
